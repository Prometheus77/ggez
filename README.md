## Installation

If installing for the first time, install via:

```r
devtools::install_github("Prometheus77/ggez")
```

If that doesn't work, try this first:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

And then again try the previous command.

If re-installing to get latest update, use:

```r
devtools::install_github("Prometheus77/ggez", force = TRUE)
```
